Hi! I'm Jeremy, an electrical engineer from the mountains of Western North Carolina! I'm currently working on an [artificial pancreas][imt] for a small startup I cofounded, as the sole engineer ([for now!][hiring]).

I dig deep space robotics, climbing, and all the weird stuff you can pull off with Python!

If there's anything missing or incorrect or incoherent in the articles here, feel free to [send me an email][mailto:jcdejournett@gmail.com], or open a [pull request][pulls]. Thanks for coming by!
